# Getting a million downloads on Google Play Store!

[Project](https://sta210-fa20.netlify.app/project/) for STA 210, Fall 2020

In this project, we investigated a dataset called “Google Play Store Apps.” The dataset, which we retrieved from Kaggle. Our research question was “For Google Play Store Apps, to what extent are the aspects of the application such as ratings, genre, pricing, size, and other variables in the dataset predictive of the odds of the app having more than 1 million downloads?” Thus, our goal was to predict the odds that an app has more than a million installs given the features associated with an app. 

We used the logistic regression model to fit the data as we are looking at the factors that relate to the *odds* of an app getting more than a million installs. After using backward selection with BIC as our model fit criterion, we found that the odds of having greater than 1 million installs for apps on the Google Play Store is greater with higher ratings, a greater number of reviews, a recent update, and if the app is free. We also found that apps that are not rated to be only for 18+ tend to have higher odds of having greater than 1 million installs than apps that are only for adults (18+). App developers can hone in on these insights to make more successful applications, where success relates to the number of installs of the app; however, limitations of this analysis must be considered as well.
